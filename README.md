#Just Do The Thing

A simple, work-in-progress webapp to track progress towards goals and habits, built on HTML5, jQuery, Vanilla JS, and Local Storage APIs.

##Setup

Download the ZIP file, unzip it, and load index.html in your browser of choice that supports Local Storage APIs, of course.

##How To Use It

On first launch, you'll be asked to provide a goal. I suggest you pick one that's positive and active. For example, instead of:

> Don't smoke cigarettes

better to use something like:

> Chew gum when I want a cigarette
 
This is just an example, but it's been shown that you're more likely to achieve a change of habit when you have a new action to take instead of telling yourself not to do something.

###Great! I just did the thing!

If you've accomplished your goal today, click "I did the thing" and your progress will be saved in the browser. If you have not done the thing, click "I did not do the thing." You'll have a chance to make it up, though. The point is to keep up the streak! If you really did miss the day, though, click "I did not do the thing" again and your progress will reset, giving you a clean slate to try again.

###I forgot to check in yesterday!

*Just Do The Thing* has you covered. If you miss a day in the app, but still worked towards your goal, you'll be asked, next time you load it. Say yes, and you'll be caught up. But you only get one day's grace. If you didn't do the thing yesterday, your streak and progress resets to zero.

###But I want to accomplish a bunch of things!

This isn't the app for you. Or, maybe it is. The more goals you set and habits you try to change, the more likely something's going to break and you'll end up right where you started. *Just Do The Thing* lets you focus on one specific habit, where you're more likely to succeed. Once you feel like you've had enough time to make the change in your life, and that it's stuck, you can change your goal and focus on something else.
